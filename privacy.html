    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>At ShadowSecrets we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you provide to us. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it and the choices you have regarding your information. By using our website you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you subscribe to our newsletter or join the Inner Circle. This typically includes your email address. In addition, we may automatically collect certain information through cookies and similar technologies, such as your IP address, browser type, device identifiers and pages viewed.</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <li>Understand how visitors interact with our site and measure the effectiveness of our content and advertising.</li>

    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share aggregated, anonymised analytics data with service providers who help us run our website. When we use third‑party ad networks such as Google Ads, those partners may use cookies to personalise ads based on your prior visits to our site.
